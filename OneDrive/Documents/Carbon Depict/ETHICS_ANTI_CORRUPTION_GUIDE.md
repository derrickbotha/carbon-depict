## 🧮 Automated Calculation Functions

### 1. **Training Coverage Calculator**

**Purpose:** Measure the percentage of employees receiving ethics training

**Function:**
```javascript
calculateTrainingCoverage(trained, total)
```

**Formula:**
```
Training Coverage (%) = (Employees Trained ÷ Total Employees) × 100
```

**Example:**
- Employees Trained: 850
- Total Employees: 1000
- Training Coverage = (850 ÷ 1000) × 100 = **85%**

**Framework Requirements:**
- **GRI 205-2:** Communication and training about anti-corruption
- **CSRD G1-4:** Anti-corruption and anti-bribery

**Best Practice Benchmarks:**
- **100%:** Best practice (universal training)
- **90-99%:** Good coverage
- **< 90%:** Below recommended level

**Training Frequency:**
- New employees: Within 90 days of hire
- All employees: Annual refresher training
- Management: Enhanced training every 6-12 months
- Board members: Annual specialized training

---

### 2. **Incident Rate Calculator**

**Purpose:** Calculate corruption incidents per 1,000 employees

**Function:**
```javascript
calculateIncidentRate(incidents, employees)
```

**Formula:**
```
Incident Rate = (Total Incidents ÷ Total Employees) × 1,000
```

**Example:**
- Corruption Incidents: 2
- Total Employees: 5,000
- Incident Rate = (2 ÷ 5,000) × 1,000 = **0.4 per 1,000 employees**

**Framework Requirements:**
- **GRI 205-3:** Confirmed incidents of corruption
- **CSRD G1-4:** Number of convictions and fines

**Interpretation:**
- **0:** Excellent (zero incidents)
- **< 1 per 1,000:** Low risk
- **1-5 per 1,000:** Moderate concern
- **{'>'} 5 per 1,000:** High risk - immediate action required

**Note:** Target should be ZERO confirmed incidents. Any confirmed case requires:
- Immediate investigation
- Disciplinary action
- Root cause analysis
- Remedial measures
- Board notification

---

### 3. **Whistleblower Resolution Rate**

**Purpose:** Calculate percentage of whistleblower reports resolved

**Function:**
```javascript
calculateResolutionRate(resolved, total)
```

**Formula:**
```
Resolution Rate (%) = (Reports Resolved ÷ Total Reports) × 100
```

**Example:**
- Reports Resolved: 28
- Total Reports: 30
- Resolution Rate = (28 ÷ 30) × 100 = **93.3%**

**Framework Requirements:**
- **GRI 2-26:** Mechanisms for seeking advice and raising concerns
- **CSRD G1-1:** Whistleblower protection mechanisms

**Best Practice Benchmarks:**
- **{'>'} 90%:** Excellent case management
- **75-90%:** Adequate but room for improvement
- **< 75%:** Poor case management - review processes

**Target Timelines:**
- Initial acknowledgment: Within 5 business days
- Investigation completion: Within 30-60 days
- Resolution: Within 90 days for standard cases
- Complex cases: Extended timeline with regular updates

---

### 4. **Supply Chain Risk Percentage**

**Purpose:** Calculate percentage of suppliers identified as high-risk

**Function:**
```javascript
calculateSupplierRiskPercentage(highRisk, assessed)
```

**Formula:**
```
High-Risk Percentage (%) = (High-Risk Suppliers ÷ Suppliers Assessed) × 100
```

**Example:**
- High-Risk Suppliers: 12
- Suppliers Assessed: 150
- Risk Percentage = (12 ÷ 150) × 100 = **8%**

**Framework Requirements:**
- **GRI 205-2:** Anti-corruption training for business partners
- **CSRD G1-4:** Corruption and bribery prevention

**Interpretation:**
- **< 10%:** Acceptable risk profile
- **10-20%:** Elevated risk - increase monitoring
- **{'>'} 20%:** High risk - review supplier base

**High-Risk Indicators:**
- Operations in high corruption perception index (CPI) countries
