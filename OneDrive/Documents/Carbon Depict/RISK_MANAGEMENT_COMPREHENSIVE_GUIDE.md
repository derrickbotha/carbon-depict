### 2. **Climate Risk Exposure Calculator**

**Purpose:** Quantify total climate-related risks (TCFD compliance)

**Function:**
```javascript
calculateClimateRiskExposure()
```

**Formula:**
```
Total Climate Risks = Physical Risks + Transition Risks

Exposure Level:
- Low: 0-5 total risks
- Moderate: 6-10 total risks
- High: 11+ total risks
```

**Example:**
- Physical Risks Identified: 6 (floods, heat waves, water stress, storms, sea-level rise, droughts)
- Transition Risks Identified: 8 (carbon pricing, regulation, tech shifts, market changes, reputation, legal, stranded assets, cost increases)
- Total Climate Risks = 6 + 8 = **14 (High Exposure)**

**Physical Risks (Examples):**
1. Acute: Extreme weather events (floods, storms, wildfires, heat waves)
2. Chronic: Long-term shifts (temperature rise, sea-level rise, water stress, biodiversity loss)

**Transition Risks (Examples):**
1. Policy & Legal: Carbon pricing, emissions regulations, litigation
2. Technology: Low-carbon technology disruption, renewable energy shifts
3. Market: Changing customer preferences, increased raw material costs
4. Reputation: Stakeholder concerns, negative publicity

**Framework Requirements:**

3. Quantify potential financial impact
4. Prioritize by materiality
5. Develop mitigation strategies
6. Monitor and report regularly

---

### 3. **Risk Coverage Percentage**

**Purpose:** Measure comprehensiveness of risk assessment

**Function:**
```javascript
calculateRiskCoverage(risksIdentified, totalCategories)
```

**Formula:**
```
Risk Coverage (%) = (Risk Categories with Identified Risks Ã· Total Risk Categories) Ã— 100
```

**Example:**
- Risk Categories with Identified Risks: 8 out of 10
- Total Risk Categories: 10
- Coverage = (8 Ã· 10) Ã— 100 = **80%**

**Risk Categories:**
1. Strategic Risks
2. Operational Risks
3. Financial Risks
4. Compliance/Regulatory Risks
5. Climate/Environmental Risks
6. Social Risks
7. Technology/Cyber Risks
8. Reputational Risks
9. Supply Chain Risks
10. Emerging Risks

**Target:** 100% coverage across all material risk categories

## ðŸš¨ Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: Siloed Risk Management
**Problem:** Climate risks managed separately from ERM
**Solution:** Integrate climate into enterprise-wide framework, shared governance, common metrics

### Pitfall 2: Inadequate Board Engagement
**Problem:** Board not sufficiently involved in risk oversight
**Solution:** Quarterly board reviews, dedicated risk committee, clear escalation protocols

### Pitfall 3: Static Risk Assessment
**Problem:** Risk assessment conducted once and not updated
**Solution:** Annual comprehensive review, quarterly updates, continuous monitoring of KRIs

### Pitfall 4: No Scenario Analysis
**Problem:** Climate risks assessed in single scenario or current state only
**Solution:** Use multiple scenarios (2Â°C, 4Â°C), multiple time horizons, quantify financial impacts

### Pitfall 5: Poor Risk Culture
**Problem:** Risk management seen as compliance exercise, not value-driver
**Solution:** Tone from the top, embed in strategy, link to incentives, celebrate good risk decisions

### Pitfall 6: Insufficient Resources
**Problem:** Underfunded risk function, limited expertise
**Solution:** Invest in risk talent, provide training, use external advisors, implement technology

### Pitfall 7: Weak Cybersecurity
**Problem:** Reactive approach, no incident response plan, insufficient testing
**Solution:** Adopt NIST/ISO framework, test response plan annually, continuous monitoring, insurance

### Pitfall 8: Emerging Risk Blindness
**Problem:** Focus only on known risks, miss emerging threats
**Solution:** Horizon scanning process, external perspectives, scenario thinking, innovation mindset
