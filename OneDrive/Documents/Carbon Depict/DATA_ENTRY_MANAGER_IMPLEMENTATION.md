# Data Entry Manager Implementation Complete

## Summary
Successfully created a reusable `DataEntryManager` component and integrated it into all Scope 1, 2, and 3 data collection forms.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Created DataEntryManager Component
**File**: `src/components/molecules/DataEntryManager.jsx`

**Features**:
- ✅ View last entry with details (date, values, reporting period)
- ✅ Edit last entry (load data into form for editing)
- ✅ Save changes with visual feedback
- ✅ Delete entries from history
- ✅ Entry history viewing
- ✅ Save status indicators (saving, saved, error)
- ✅ Works with both emissions and ESG metrics

### 2. Integrated into Scope Forms
**Updated Files**:
- ✅ `src/pages/dashboard/Scope1DataCollection.jsx`
- ✅ `src/pages/dashboard/Scope2DataCollection.jsx`  
- ✅ `src/pages/dashboard/Scope3DataCollection.jsx`

**Integration**:
```jsx
<DataEntryManager
  formType="emissions"
  scope="scope1"
  formData={formData}
  setFormData={setFormData}
  onSave={handleCalculateEmissions}
  isLoading={isSaving}
/>
```

## How It Works

### For Users:
1. **View Last Entry**: Shows when last data was entered with details
2. **Edit Last Entry**: Load previous data to make changes
3. **Save Changes**: Update existing entries instead of creating duplicates
4. **Entry History**: See recent entries with ability to load or delete them

### For Developers:
1. **Reusable**: Works with any data collection form
2. **Flexible**: Supports both emissions and ESG metrics
3. **Automatic**: Loads data on form mount
4. **Visual Feedback**: Status indicators for all actions

## Features

### 1. Last Entry Display
- Shows timestamp of last entry
- Displays key values (emissions, ESG metrics)
- Quick "View" and "Edit" buttons
- Loading state while fetching data

### 2. Edit Mode

- Visual indicator when editing
- Cancel button to discard changes
- Save button to persist changes

### 3. Entry History
