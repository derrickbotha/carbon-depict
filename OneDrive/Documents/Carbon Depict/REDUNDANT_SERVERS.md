# âœ… Redundant Server Management Solution

## Problem Solved
Previously, servers would stop when running commands in the same terminal. This has been fixed with isolated terminal windows for each server.

## New Features Implemented

### 1. **start-servers.ps1** - Robust Server Startup
- Stops any existing Node processes
- Opens **separate terminal windows** for each server
- Backend runs in its own isolated terminal
- Frontend runs in its own isolated terminal
- Displays status and credentials
- Terminals remain open even after commands complete

### 2. **stop-servers.ps1** - Clean Shutdown
- Gracefully stops all Node.js processes
- Reports number of processes stopped
- Safe to run anytime

### 3. **NPM Scripts Added**
```json
"start:all": "Start both servers in separate terminals"
"stop:all": "Stop all servers"
```

## Usage

### Start Servers (Recommended Method)
```powershell
npm run start:all
```

**What happens:**
1. âœ… Stops any existing Node processes
2. âœ… Opens new terminal window for backend (port 5500)
3. âœ… Opens new terminal window for frontend (port 3500)
4. âœ… Each server runs independently
5. âœ… Status message shows URLs and credentials
6. âœ… You can close the startup window, servers keep running

### Stop All Servers
```powershell
npm run stop:all
```

## Why This Solution is Redundant/Reliable

### âœ… Isolation
- Each server runs in its own terminal window
- No interference between processes
- Can monitor each server independently

### âœ… Persistence  
- Servers keep running even if you:
  - Close the startup window
  - Run other commands
  - Open new terminals

### âœ… Easy Monitoring
- See backend logs in one window
- See frontend logs in another window
- Can restart individually if needed

### âœ… Clean Shutdown
- One command stops all servers
- No orphaned processes
- Safe restart anytime

## Files Created

1. **start-servers.ps1** - Server startup script
2. **stop-servers.ps1** - Server shutdown script
3. **SERVER_MANAGEMENT.md** - Complete documentation
4. **REDUNDANT_SERVERS.md** - This file
5. **package.json** - Updated with new scripts

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Start both servers | `npm run start:all` |
| Stop all servers | `npm run stop:all` |
| Check what's running | `Get-Process -Name node` |
| Kill stuck processes | `Get-Process -Name node \| Stop-Process -Force` |

## Server URLs

- **Backend:** http://localhost:5500
- **Frontend:** http://localhost:3500
- **Login:** http://localhost:3500/login
- **Clear Cache:** http://localhost:3500/clear-cache.html

## Login Credentials

- Email: `db@carbondepict.com`
- Password: `db123!@#DB`
- Role: `admin`

## Troubleshooting

### If servers won't start
```powershell
# Stop everything
npm run stop:all

# Wait 2 seconds
Start-Sleep -Seconds 2

# Start again
npm run start:all
```

### If you see port conflicts
```powershell
# Check what's using the ports
netstat -ano | findstr ":3500"
netstat -ano | findstr ":5500"

# Stop all Node processes
npm run stop:all
```

### If terminal windows don't open
Check PowerShell execution policy:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Benefits Summary

âœ… **No More Crashed Servers** - Each runs independently  
âœ… **Easy Monitoring** - Separate windows for each server  
âœ… **Clean Startup/Shutdown** - One command for both  
âœ… **Developer Friendly** - Can see logs in real-time  
âœ… **Production Ready** - Reliable for testing  

## Next Steps

1. Run `npm run start:all` to start servers
2. Open http://localhost:3500 in browser
3. Login with test credentials
4. Start developing!

When done:
```powershell
npm run stop:all
```

That's it! No more server crashes! ðŸŽ‰
