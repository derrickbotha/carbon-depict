# Delete Functionality Fixed ✅

## Summary
Fixed the "Failed to delete entry" error by correcting company ID comparison logic in backend routes.

## Root Cause
The delete endpoints were comparing incorrect types:
- `emission.companyId` (ObjectId or string)
- `req.user.company` (populated Mongoose document)

## Fix Applied
Updated all CRUD endpoints to use the correct company ID comparison pattern:

```javascript
// Get companyId from auth middleware
const companyId = req.companyId || req.user?.companyId

// Check access with proper type handling
const emissionCompanyId = emission.companyId?.toString() || emission.companyId
const userCompanyId = companyId || req.user?.company?._id?.toString()

if (emissionCompanyId !== userCompanyId) {
  console.error('Access denied details:', {
    emissionCompanyId,
    userCompanyId,
    reqCompanyId: companyId
  })
  return res.status(403).json({ success: false, error: 'Access denied' })
}
```

## Files Fixed
- ✅ `server/routes/emissions.js` - GET, PUT, DELETE endpoints
- ✅ `server/routes/esg-metrics.js` - DELETE endpoint

## Testing
To verify the fix works:
1. Navigate to any data entry form
2. View entry history
3. Click delete icon
4. Confirm deletion
5. Entry should be successfully deleted

## Status: COMPLETE ✅
