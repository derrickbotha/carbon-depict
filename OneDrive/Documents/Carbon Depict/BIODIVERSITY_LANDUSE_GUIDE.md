# Biodiversity & Land Use Data Entry Guide

## Overview
This guide describes the Biodiversity & Land Use data entry form, covering all major ESG frameworks: SDG, SBTi, GRI, CSRD, CDP, and TCFD. The form is accessible from the ESG Data Entry Hub and supports comprehensive reporting, analytics, and progress tracking.

## Framework Mapping
- **SDG**: Life on Land, Climate Action, Responsible Consumption
- **SBTi**: Land use change, biodiversity targets
- **GRI**: 304 (Biodiversity), 305 (Emissions), 306 (Effluents)
- **CSRD**: Biodiversity, ecosystem services, land use
- **CDP**: Forests, biodiversity, land management
- **TCFD**: Climate-related risks/opportunities, land use impact

## Categories & Fields
1. **Habitat**
   - Total area managed (ha)
   - Critical habitats identified
   - Habitat fragmentation index
2. **Species**
   - Endangered species present
   - Species richness (count)
   - Invasive species management
3. **Land Use Change**
   - Land converted (ha)
   - Deforestation rate (%)
   - Land restoration projects
4. **Restoration**
   - Area restored (ha)
   - Restoration success rate (%)
   - Native species reintroduced
5. **Protected Areas**
   - Protected area coverage (%)
   - Compliance with IUCN categories
   - Buffer zone management
6. **Impact Assessment**
   - Biodiversity impact score
   - Environmental risk assessment
   - Mitigation measures implemented
7. **Supply Chain**
   - Supplier biodiversity risk
   - Land use in supply chain (ha)
   - Traceability of raw materials
8. **Policy & Governance**
   - Biodiversity policy in place
   - Governance structure for biodiversity
   - Stakeholder engagement
9. **Community Engagement**
   - Local community projects
   - Education & awareness programs
   - Indigenous rights respected

## Automated Analytics
- Biodiversity score: % of fields completed
- Progress tracking: Visual dashboard
- Framework alignment: Each field mapped to relevant frameworks

## Best Practices
- Use scientific data sources for habitat/species fields
- Engage stakeholders for policy/governance inputs
- Track restoration and land use change annually
- Align reporting with GRI 304, CSRD, and CDP requirements

## Implementation Roadmap
1. Complete all required fields in the form
2. Review automated biodiversity score and progress
3. Export data for ESG reporting (GRI, CSRD, CDP, TCFD)
4. Update regularly to reflect new projects and changes
