## ðŸ§® Automated Calculation Functions

### 1. **Board Independence Ratio**

**Purpose:** Measure the percentage of independent directors on the board

**Function:**
```javascript
calculateIndependenceRatio(independent, total)
```

**Formula:**
```
Independence Ratio (%) = (Number of Independent Directors Ã· Total Directors) Ã— 100
```

**Example:**
- Independent Directors: 6
- Total Directors: 10
- Independence Ratio = (6 Ã· 10) Ã— 100 = **60%**

**Framework Requirements:**
- **GRI 2-9:** Governance structure and composition
- **CSRD G1-1:** Composition of administrative, management and supervisory bodies
- **TCFD:** Board oversight of climate-related issues

**Best Practice Benchmarks:**
- **â‰¥ 50%:** Best practice (majority independent)
- **33-50%:** Adequate but below best practice
- **< 33%:** Below recommended level

**Definition of Independence:**
An independent director has no material relationship with the company that could interfere with exercising independent judgment. This includes:
- Not being a current or recent employee
- Not having significant business relationships
- Not being a family member of executives
- Not receiving compensation beyond director fees

### 2. **Gender Diversity Metrics**

**Purpose:** Calculate female representation on the board

**Function:**
```javascript
calculateDiversityMetrics(category, total)
```

**Formula:**
```
Gender Diversity (%) = (Female Directors Ã· Total Directors) Ã— 100
Gender Ratio = Female:Male
```

**Example:**
- Female Directors: 4
- Total Directors: 10
- Female Representation = (4 Ã· 10) Ã— 100 = **40%**
- Gender Ratio = **4:6**

**Framework Requirements:**
- **GRI 405-1:** Diversity of governance bodies and employees
- **CSRD G1-1:** Gender balance in administrative, management and supervisory bodies

**Best Practice Benchmarks:**
- **40-60%:** Excellent gender balance (parity zone)
- **30-40%:** Good progress toward parity
- **< 30%:** Below recommended target

**Regulatory Landscape:**
- **EU:** Many countries mandate 40% female representation on boards
- **UK:** FTSE 350 target of 40% women on boards by 2025
- **US:** California requires minimum female board representation
- **Global:** Increasing trend toward 30-40% minimums

### 3. **Average Board Age Calculator**

**Purpose:** Calculate estimated average age of board members

**Function:**
```javascript
calculateAverageAge(under50, age50to70, over70)
```

**Formula:**
```
Average Age = ((Under 50 Ã— 40) + (50-70 Ã— 60) + (Over 70 Ã— 75)) Ã· Total Directors
```

**Methodology:**
Uses midpoint of each age bracket for weighted average calculation:
- Under 50: Uses 40 years as midpoint
- 50-70: Uses 60 years as midpoint
- Over 70: Uses 75 years as midpoint

**Example:**
- Directors Under 50: 2 (weighted at 40 years)
- Directors 50-70: 6 (weighted at 60 years)
- Directors Over 70: 2 (weighted at 75 years)
- Average = ((2Ã—40) + (6Ã—60) + (2Ã—75)) Ã· 10 = **59 years**

**Framework Requirements:**
- **GRI 405-1:** Diversity by age group
- **CSRD G1-1:** Age diversity of governance bodies

**Interpretation:**
- **< 55:** Younger board, may lack experience
- **55-65:** Balanced age profile
- **> 65:** Older board, succession planning recommended

### 4. **Average Board Tenure Calculator**

**Purpose:** Calculate average length of service for board members

**Function:**
```javascript
calculateAverageTenure(under3, years3to6, years6to9, over9)
```

**Formula:**
```
Average Tenure = ((< 3 yrs Ã— 1.5) + (3-6 yrs Ã— 4.5) + (6-9 yrs Ã— 7.5) + (> 9 yrs Ã— 10)) Ã· Total
```

**Methodology:**
Uses midpoint of each tenure bracket:
- Under 3 years: 1.5 years
- 3-6 years: 4.5 years
- 6-9 years: 7.5 years
- Over 9 years: 10 years (conservative estimate)

**Example:**
- Under 3 years: 3 directors
- 3-6 years: 4 directors
- 6-9 years: 2 directors
- Over 9 years: 1 director
- Average = ((3Ã—1.5) + (4Ã—4.5) + (2Ã—7.5) + (1Ã—10)) Ã· 10 = **4.95 years**

**Framework Requirements:**
- **CSRD G1-1:** Tenure of administrative, management and supervisory bodies

**Interpretation:**
- **< 3 years:** High turnover, potential instability
- **3-7 years:** Optimal balance of fresh perspectives and experience
- **> 9 years:** Risk of entrenched thinking, review term limits

**Best Practice:**
- Stagger board terms for continuity
- Consider term limits (e.g., 9-12 years maximum)
- Regular board refreshment (1-2 new members per year)

### 5. **Climate/ESG Expertise Percentage**

**Purpose:** Measure board competence in climate-related issues

**Function:**
```javascript
calculateDiversityMetrics(climateExperts, total)
```

**Formula:**
```
Climate Expertise (%) = (Directors with Climate/ESG Expertise Ã· Total Directors) Ã— 100
```

**Example:**
- Directors with Climate Expertise: 3
- Total Directors: 10
- Climate Expertise = (3 Ã· 10) Ã— 100 = **30%**

**Framework Requirements:**
- **TCFD:** Describe board members' expertise in climate-related issues
- **CSRD G1-1:** Expertise and skills of administrative, management bodies

**What Counts as Climate/ESG Expertise:**
- Background in environmental science or policy
- Experience in sustainability management
- ESG investment expertise
- Renewable energy industry experience
- Climate risk management
- Circular economy experience
- Corporate sustainability leadership

**Best Practice:**
- **Minimum:** At least 1 board member with deep climate expertise
- **Target:** 20-30% of board with climate/ESG competence
- **Leading Practice:** Dedicated ESG/Sustainability Committee
