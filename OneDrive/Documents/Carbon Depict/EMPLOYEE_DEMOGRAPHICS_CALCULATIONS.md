## üßÆ Automated Calculation Functions

### 1. **Turnover Rate Calculator**

**Purpose:** Calculate employee turnover rate as required by GRI 401-1 and CSRD S1-6

**Function:**
```javascript
calculateTurnoverRate(departures, avgEmployees)
```

**Formula:**
```
Turnover Rate (%) = (Total Departures √∑ Average Number of Employees) √ó 100
```

**Example:**
- Departures: 25 employees
- Average Employees: 200 employees
- Turnover Rate = (25 √∑ 200) √ó 100 = **12.5%**

**Framework Requirements:**
- **GRI 401-1:** Total number and rate of employee turnover
- **CSRD S1-6:** Employee turnover rates during the reporting period

**Interpretation:**
- < 10%: Low turnover (healthy retention)
- 10-20%: Moderate turnover (industry average)
- > 20%: High turnover (may indicate issues)

### 2. **Gender Pay Gap Calculator**

**Purpose:** Calculate gender pay gap as required by GRI 405-2 and CSRD S1-13

**Function:**
```javascript
calculateGenderPayGap(malePay, femalePay)
```

**Formula:**
```
Gender Pay Gap (%) = ((Male Median Pay - Female Median Pay) √∑ Male Median Pay) √ó 100
```

**Example:**
- Male Median Pay: ¬£50,000
- Female Median Pay: ¬£45,000
- Gender Pay Gap = ((50,000 - 45,000) √∑ 50,000) √ó 100 = **10%**

**Framework Requirements:**
- **GRI 405-2:** Ratio of basic salary and remuneration of women to men
- **CSRD S1-13:** Gender pay gap (unadjusted and adjusted)

**Interpretation:**
- 0-5%: Excellent pay equity
- 5-15%: Moderate gap, improvement recommended
- > 15%: Significant gap, urgent action needed

**Note:** This is the **unadjusted** pay gap. The adjusted pay gap accounts for factors like job role, experience, and hours worked.

### 3. **CEO Pay Ratio Calculator**

**Purpose:** Calculate CEO-to-median employee pay ratio as required by GRI 2-21 and CSRD S1-13

**Function:**
```javascript
calculateCEOPayRatio(ceoCompensation, medianEmployeeCompensation)
```

**Formula:**
```
CEO Pay Ratio = CEO Total Compensation √∑ Median Employee Compensation
```

**Example:**
- CEO Total Compensation: ¬£2,500,000
- Median Employee Compensation: ¬£35,000
- CEO Pay Ratio = 2,500,000 √∑ 35,000 = **71:1**

**Framework Requirements:**
- **GRI 2-21:** Annual total compensation ratio
- **CSRD S1-13:** Ratio between highest paid individual and median

**Interpretation:**
- < 50:1: Low ratio (more equitable)
- 50-200:1: Moderate ratio (typical for mid-size companies)
- > 200:1: High ratio (may raise stakeholder concerns)

### 4. **Worker Categorization Calculator**

**Purpose:** Properly categorize direct employees vs. contractors as required by GRI 2-7 and GRI 2-8

**Function:**
```javascript
categorizeWorkers(totalEmployees, contractors)
```

**Output:**
- Direct Employees (GRI 2-7)
- Indirect Workers (GRI 2-8)
- Total Workforce
- Employee Percentage

**Example:**
- Total Employees: 500
- Contractors: 75
- Results:
  - Direct Employees: 500
  - Indirect Workers: 75
  - Total Workforce: 575
  - Employee Percentage: 87.0%

**Framework Requirements:**
- **GRI 2-7:** Employees (direct workers with employment contract)
- **GRI 2-8:** Workers who are not employees (contractors, consultants, agency workers)
- **CSRD S1-6:** Characteristics of own employees

**Critical Distinction:**
- **Employees:** Workers with direct employment contract with the organization
- **Non-Employees:** Independent contractors, consultants, temporary agency workers, on-call workers

## üìä Additional Automated Metrics

### 5. **Gender Distribution Analysis**

**Automatic Calculation:**
When male and female employee counts are entered, the system automatically calculates:
- Percentage of male employees
- Percentage of female employees
- Percentage of non-binary employees (if applicable)

**Example:**
- Male: 300 (60%)
- Female: 180 (36%)
- Non-binary: 20 (4%)
- Total: 500 (100%)

## üéØ How to Use Automated Calculations

### Step 1: Enter Data
Fill in the required fields in each category:
- **Workforce Composition:** Total employees, contractors
- **New Hires & Turnover:** Departures, new hires
- **Pay & Compensation:** Pay gap, CEO ratio

### Step 2: View Real-Time Calculations
Automated calculations appear in **green boxes** below the form fields when sufficient data is entered.

### Step 3: Show Full Summary
Click the **"Show Automated Calculations"** button at the bottom of the form to see a comprehensive summary of all calculated metrics.

### Step 4: Interpret Results
Each calculation includes:
- ‚úÖ The calculated value
- üìê The formula used
- üìä Contextual interpretation (where applicable)

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### React Hooks Used:
- `useCallback`: Memoizes calculation functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- `useMemo`: Caches computed values
- `useState`: Manages calculation visibility state

### Performance Optimizations:
- Calculations only run when relevant data changes
- Conditional rendering prevents unnecessary DOM updates
- Memoized functions reduce function recreation on each render

### Formula Display:
Each calculation shows:
1. **Input values** used in the calculation
2. **Formula** with actual numbers substituted
3. **Result** prominently displayed
4. **Interpretation** (for key metrics)

## üí° Tips for Data Entry

1. **Always enter total employees first** - This is used in multiple calculations
2. **Use consistent time periods** - All data should be from the same reporting period
3. **Double-check pay figures** - Ensure median pay figures are accurate
4. **Include all departures** - Count voluntary resignations, retirements, and dismissals
5. **Separate employees from contractors** - Critical for GRI 2-7 vs 2-8 compliance
