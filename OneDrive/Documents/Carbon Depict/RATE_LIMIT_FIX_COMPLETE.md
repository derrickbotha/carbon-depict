# Rate Limit Fix Complete ✅

## Issue Resolved
The 429 (Too Many Requests) errors for `/api/auth/` endpoints have been fixed.

## Root Cause
The rate limiter was being applied globally with a `skip` function that wasn't working correctly. Auth endpoints were hitting the rate limiter even though they should have been bypassed.

## Solution Implemented
Modified `server/index.js` to explicitly skip rate limiting for auth routes by checking the path before applying the limiter:

```javascript
// Apply rate limiting to all API routes except auth
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  // Skip auth routes
  if (req.path.startsWith('/api/auth/')) {
    return next()
  }
  limiter(req, res, next)
})
```

## Verification
- ✅ Backend running on port 5500
- ✅ Auth endpoints no longer return 429 errors
- ✅ Rate limiting still active for other endpoints
- ✅ Login now works without rate limit issues

## Current System Status

| Component | Status | Port |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Backend | ✅ Running | 5500 |
| Frontend | ✅ Running | 3500 |
| Rate Limiting | ✅ Fixed | N/A |

## Testing
Auth endpoints can now be called repeatedly without hitting rate limits:
- `/api/auth/login` ✅
- `/api/auth/me` ✅
- `/api/auth/register` ✅

Rate limiting is still active for non-auth endpoints to prevent abuse.
