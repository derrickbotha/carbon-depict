# Testing ESG Data Flow

## ‚úÖ Completed Integration

### Phase 1: GRI Framework + Dashboard
The GRI data collection page and ESG dashboard are now connected with live data flow!

## üß™ How to Test

### Step 1: Start the Development Server
```bash
cd "c:\Users\dbmos\OneDrive\Documents\Carbon Depict"
npm run dev
```
The app should be running at http://localhost:3500

### Step 2: Navigate to GRI Data Collection
1. Go to http://localhost:3500/dashboard
2. Click on "ESG" in the left sidebar
3. Click on the "GRI" framework card
4. You'll see the GRI Standards 2021 data collection form

### Step 3: Enter Some Test Data
Try entering data in a few fields, for example:
- **2-1: Organizational details** - "ABC Corporation, headquartered in New York, USA. Operating in 15 countries across North America, Europe, and Asia. Legal form: Public Limited Company."
- **2-2: Entities included** - "Includes parent company and all subsidiaries with >50% ownership. Consolidated financial reporting follows IFRS standards."
- **2-3: Reporting period** - "January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024. This report is published annually."

### Step 4: Verify Data Persistence
1. Refresh the browser (F5)
2. Navigate back to the GRI page
3. **Your data should still be there!** ‚úÖ

This proves the localStorage persistence is working.

### Step 5: Check Live Dashboard Updates
1. Navigate to the ESG Dashboard home: http://localhost:3500/dashboard/esg
2. Look at the GRI framework card
3. **You should see the progress percentage** matching how many fields you completed!

Example:
- If you filled 3 out of 43 fields, you'll see ~7% progress
- The progress bar will be green and show "7%"

### Step 6: Watch Real-Time Updates
1. Open two browser tabs side-by-side:
   - Tab 1: http://localhost:3500/dashboard/esg (Dashboard)
   - Tab 2: http://localhost:3500/dashboard/esg/gri (GRI Form)
2. In Tab 2, add more data to the form
3. Wait 5 seconds (dashboard auto-refreshes every 5 seconds)
4. **Watch Tab 1 update with new progress!** ‚úÖ

## üìä What's Working

### Data Persistence
- ‚úÖ All form data saves to browser localStorage automatically
- ‚úÖ Data persists across page refreshes
- ‚úÖ Progress calculation happens in real-time

### Live Dashboard
- ‚úÖ ESG Dashboard shows live progress from GRI form
- ‚úÖ Auto-refreshes every 5 seconds
- ‚úÖ E/S/G scores calculated from framework data
- ‚úÖ Framework cards show real completion percentages

### Data Flow
```
User types in GRI form
    ‚Üì
updateField() function called
    ‚Üì
esgDataManager.saveFrameworkData('gri', data)
    ‚Üì
Data saved to localStorage
    ‚Üì
Progress calculated automatically
    ‚Üì
Dashboard reads esgDataManager.getScores()
    ‚Üì
Shows live progress percentage
```

## üîç Developer Tools Testing

### Check localStorage
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to "Application" tab ‚Üí "Local Storage" ‚Üí "http://localhost:3500"
3. You should see two keys:
   - `carbondepict_esg_data` - Contains all your form data
   - `carbondepict_framework_scores` - Contains progress and scores

### View Stored Data
In the browser console, run:
```javascript
// View all ESG data
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('carbondepict_esg_data')))

// View current scores
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('carbondepict_framework_scores')))
```

## üìù Expected Results

### After entering 5 GRI fields:
```javascript
{
  frameworks: {
    gri: {
      progress: 11.63,  // 5 out of 43 fields = ~12%
      score: 0,         // No AI score yet
      lastUpdated: "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
    },
    tcfd: { progress: 0, score: 0 },
    // ... other frameworks
  },
  environmental: 11.63,  // Based on GRI environmental disclosures
  social: 0,
  governance: 0,
  overall: 2.33  // Weighted average: E(40%) + S(30%) + G(30%)
}
```

## üéØ Next Steps

### Phase 2: Connect Other Frameworks
Now that GRI is working, we need to replicate this pattern for:
- [ ] TCFD Data Collection
- [ ] SBTi Data Collection
- [ ] CSRD Data Collection
- [ ] CDP Data Collection
- [ ] SDG Data Collection

### Phase 3: Framework Specifications
Create detailed requirement specs for AI scoring:
- [x] griFramework.js (DONE)
- [ ] tcfdFramework.js
- [ ] sbtiFramework.js
- [ ] csrdFramework.js
- [ ] cdpFramework.js
- [ ] sdgFramework.js

### Phase 4: AI Integration
Build the AI scoring service:
- [ ] Backend API endpoint
- [ ] OpenAI/Claude integration
- [ ] Prompt engineering for each framework
- [ ] Score calculation and feedback generation
- [ ] Frontend "Analyze with AI" button
- [ ] Display AI feedback in UI

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Data Not Persisting?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify localStorage is enabled (not in private browsing)
- Clear localStorage and try again: `localStorage.clear()`

### Dashboard Not Updating?
- Check that you're on the ESG dashboard home page
- Wait 5 seconds for auto-refresh
- Manually refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors

### Progress Shows 0%?
- Make sure you actually typed text in the input fields
- Verify fields are marked as completed (value.trim() !== '')
- Check localStorage to see if data was saved

## ‚ú® Success Indicators

You'll know everything is working when:
1. ‚úÖ You can type in GRI form fields
2. ‚úÖ Data persists after browser refresh
3. ‚úÖ ESG dashboard shows matching progress percentage
4. ‚úÖ Progress updates within 5 seconds of data entry
5. ‚úÖ localStorage contains your form data
6. ‚úÖ Framework card shows green progress bar

**Status**: GRI Framework + Dashboard Integration COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Date**: January 2024

**Next**: Connect remaining 5 frameworks (TCFD, SBTi, CSRD, CDP, SDG)
