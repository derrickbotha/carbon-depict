## Data Flow (Pending Backend Integration)

Current pages use mock data and display "API integration pending" alerts. Next steps:

1. **Connect to Backend APIs:**
   - GET/POST `/api/esg/metrics` - Metric data
   - GET/POST `/api/esg/targets` - Target management
   - GET/POST `/api/esg/reports/generate` - Report creation
   - GET/POST `/api/esg/materiality` - Materiality assessments

2. **Add Loading States:**
   - Skeleton loaders for initial data fetch
   - Spinner indicators during API calls

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Try-catch blocks around API calls
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Retry mechanisms

4. **Real-time Updates:**
   - WebSocket connections for live data
