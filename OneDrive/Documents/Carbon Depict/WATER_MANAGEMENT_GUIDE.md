## Automated Calculations

### 1. Water Balance Analysis
**Purpose:** Verify data consistency and understand water flows

```javascript
const calculateWaterBalance = () => {
  const withdrawal = parseFloat(totalWaterWithdrawal) || 0
  const discharge = parseFloat(totalWaterDischarge) || 0
  const consumption = withdrawal - discharge
  const consumptionRate = (consumption / withdrawal) * 100
  
  return {
    withdrawal,
    discharge,
    consumption,
    consumptionRate
  }
}
```

**Interpretation:**
- **Low Consumption Rate (0-20%):** High water return, minimal consumption (e.g., once-through cooling)
- **Medium Consumption Rate (20-60%):** Moderate consumption (e.g., manufacturing with treatment)
- **High Consumption Rate (60-100%):** Significant consumption (e.g., evaporative cooling, irrigation)

**Data Quality Check:**
- Consumption should never be negative (discharge > withdrawal indicates data error)
- Consumption rate > 100% is impossible (check data entry)

---

### 2. Water Recycling & Reuse Performance
**Purpose:** Measure circular water economy effectiveness

```javascript
const calculateRecyclingRate = () => {
  const recycled = parseFloat(waterRecycled) || 0
  const reused = parseFloat(waterReused) || 0
  const withdrawal = parseFloat(totalWaterWithdrawal) || 0
  
  const totalRecycledReused = recycled + reused
  const rate = (totalRecycledReused / withdrawal) * 100
  
  const level = rate >= 50 ? 'Excellent' : 
                rate >= 30 ? 'Good' : 
                rate >= 15 ? 'Fair' : 'Poor'
  
  return { totalRecycledReused, rate, level }
}
```

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- **Excellent (≥50%):** World-class water stewardship, leading practice
- **Good (30-49%):** Strong performance, above industry average
- **Fair (15-29%):** Moderate performance, improvement opportunities
- **Poor (<15%):** Below average, requires investment

**Industry Leaders:**

---

### 3. Water Intensity Calculations
**Purpose:** Enable efficiency tracking and benchmarking

```javascript
const calculateWaterIntensity = () => {
  const withdrawal = parseFloat(totalWaterWithdrawal) || 0
  const revenue = parseFloat(waterIntensityRevenue) || 0
  const production = parseFloat(waterIntensityProduction) || 0
  
  const results = {}
  
  if (revenue > 0) {
    results.revenueIntensity = (withdrawal / revenue).toFixed(2)
  }
  
  if (production > 0) {
    results.productionIntensity = (withdrawal / production).toFixed(2)
  }
  
  return results
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Revenue Intensity:** Cross-industry comparisons, investor reporting
- **Production Intensity:** Operational efficiency tracking, process improvements
- **Employee Intensity:** Office/facility benchmarking

**Target Setting Example:**
```
Baseline (2020): 5.0 ML per M USD revenue
Target (2030): 3.5 ML per M USD revenue (-30% intensity reduction)
Annual Reduction: 0.15 ML per M USD per year
```

---

### 4. Water Stress Exposure
**Purpose:** Quantify climate and scarcity risk exposure

```javascript
const calculateWaterStressExposure = () => {
  const total = parseFloat(totalWaterWithdrawal) || 0
  const stressAreas = parseFloat(waterStressAreas) || 0
  
  const exposure = (stressAreas / total) * 100
  
  const riskLevel = exposure >= 50 ? 'High' : 
                    exposure >= 25 ? 'Medium' : 'Low'
  
  return {
    withdrawal: total,
    stressAreas,
    exposurePercent: exposure.toFixed(1),
    riskLevel
  }
}
```

**Risk Levels:**
- **High (≥50%):** Majority of operations in water-stressed areas, urgent action needed
- **Medium (25-49%):** Significant exposure, mitigation planning required
- **Low (<25%):** Minimal exposure, routine stewardship sufficient

**WRI Aqueduct Stress Levels:**
- **Low (<10%):** Low stress
- **Low-Medium (10-20%):** Low-medium stress
- **Medium-High (20-40%):** Medium-high stress
- **High (40-80%):** High stress ⚠️
- **Extremely High (>80%):** Extremely high stress 🔴

**Mitigation Strategies for High Exposure:**
1. Implement advanced water recycling (target >50% rate)
2. Diversify water sources (rainwater harvesting, treated wastewater)
3. Relocate operations from extremely stressed areas (long-term)
4. Invest in watershed restoration and replenishment
5. Engage in water stewardship initiatives (AWS, CEO Water Mandate)

## Glossary

**Baseline Water Stress:** Ratio of total water withdrawals to available renewable surface and groundwater supplies (WRI Aqueduct definition).

**BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand):** Amount of dissolved oxygen needed by aerobic organisms to break down organic material in water at a certain temperature over a specific time period.

**COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand):** Amount of oxygen needed to chemically oxidize organic and inorganic matter in water.

**Freshwater:** Water with low concentration of dissolved salts (<1,000 mg/L total dissolved solids).

**Groundwater:** Water found underground in cracks and spaces in soil, sand, and rock (stored in aquifers).

**Produced Water:** Water extracted from the ground along with oil and gas during extraction operations.

**Surface Water:** Water found on the surface of the planet (rivers, lakes, wetlands, reservoirs).

**Third-Party Water:** Water supplied by municipal utilities or other external sources.

**TSS (Total Suspended Solids):** Solid material suspended in water, typically measured by filtration.

**Water Consumption:** Net water removed from a watershed (withdrawal minus discharge), including evaporation, incorporation into products, or discharge to a different watershed.

**Water-Stressed Area:** Region where more than 40% of available renewable water is withdrawn annually (WRI Aqueduct high stress threshold).

**Water Withdrawal:** Total volume of water removed from any source for any use, either permanently or temporarily.
