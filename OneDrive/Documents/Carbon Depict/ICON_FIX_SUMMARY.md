# Icon Component Fix Summary

## Problem
React warnings were occurring for icon components in `RiskManagementCollection.jsx`:
- `Warning: <Shield /> is using incorrect casing`
- `Warning: The tag <Shield> is unrecognized in this browser`

These warnings repeated for all 10 icon components used in the form.

## Root Cause
The `riskCategories` array was moved outside the component to fix a `ReferenceError`, but the icon fields were set as strings (`'Shield'`, `'Cloud'`, etc.) instead of actual React component references. This caused React to treat them as HTML elements rather than components.

## Solution
1. **Created `iconMap` object** to map string names to actual icon components:
```javascript
const iconMap = {
  'Shield': Shield,
  'Cloud': Cloud,
  'Target': Target,
  'Activity': Activity,
  'TrendingDown': TrendingDown,
  'Lock': Lock,
  'Thermometer': Thermometer,
  'CheckCircle2': CheckCircle2,
  'BarChart3': BarChart3,
  'AlertTriangle': AlertTriangle
}
```

2. **Updated `categoryProgress` useMemo** to resolve icon strings to components:
```javascript
const categoryProgress = useMemo(() => {
  return riskCategories.map(cat => {
    const fields = cat.fields
    const filled = fields.filter(f => formData[f.key] !== '').length
    return {
      ...cat,
      icon: typeof cat.icon === 'string' ? iconMap[cat.icon] : cat.icon,
      progress: Math.round((filled / fields.length) * 100),
      filled,
      total: fields.length
    }
  })
}, [formData])
```

3. **Updated rendering logic** in both places where `riskCategories` is mapped:
   - **Progress overview section**: Resolves icon before rendering
   - **Data collection forms section**: Resolves icon before rendering

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/dashboard/RiskManagementCollection.jsx`

## Testing
After the fix, the icons should render correctly without warnings. The Risk Management form should now:
- Display all icons properly
- Save and submit data without errors
- Show no React warnings in the console

## Status
âœ… Fixed and committed to Git
